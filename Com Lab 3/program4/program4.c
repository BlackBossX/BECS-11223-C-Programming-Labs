/*
Q1) Result = 135.000000



Q2)

because a and b is integers(int) but c is character(char) so when the print the sum of those 3 
a+b is OK
but 
a+b+c is not OK 
in this time  'A' will get it's ASCII value its equal to 65

so the output will 135.00

a + b = 70.0

so the output will

a + b + c =  135.00
