# BECS 11223 - C Programming Lab Sessions (1st Year 1st Semester)

Welcome to the repository for the **BECS 11223 - C Programming** lab sessions. This repository contains all the lab work, problem sheets, and solutions for the 1st Year module.

## Lab Sessions
There are 10 lab sessions in total, and each session includes 5-10 problems that you need to solve. The problem sheets for each session are uploaded in PDF format (e.g., `Lab_Session_01.pdf`), which provide detailed instructions for each task.

## IDE Used
For these lab sessions, I used **Notepad** for coding. This approach was chosen to help us focus on hardcoding and learning the basics effectively. Feel free to use and edit the project as needed.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlackBossX/BECS-11223-C-Programming-Labs.git
